- `conferences/` - Conference presentations, workshops, academic events
- `research/` - Research lab, projects, collaborations
- `personal/` - Personal life, travel, hobbies

## Supported Image Formats:

- PNG
- WebP
- GIF

## How to Add Photos:
1. Place your photos in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "cvpr-2020-presentation.jpg")
3. The gallery will automatically detect and display them

## File Naming Convention:
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens
- Be descriptive: "naacl-2021-workshop.jpg" instead of "IMG_001.jpg"
- Avoid spaces in filenames
